						<h2>What I Offer:</h2>

						<div class="massage-types">
							<div class="massage-type">
								<h3>Therapeutic/Sports Massage</h3>
								<p>In this type of massage, we will focus on specific problem areas using various
									techniques. It envolves movement from your part. We will continuously assess and
									reassess until improvements are observed. Dry needling may be incorporated if I find
									it may benefit you and if you are comfortable with it.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="massage-type">
								<h3>Deep Tissue/Relaxing Massage</h3>
								<p>This type of massage involves deep, slow strokes aimed at promoting release and
									relaxation. I will do most of the work, so you can relax. That makes it ideal for
									full-body sessions. Sessions of 90 or 120 minutes are recommended for a optimal
									experience.</p>
							</div>
						</div>

						<p>Most sessions combine elements of both types, tailored to your needs and preferences. To
							provide you with the best experience, communication during the treatment is essential.
							Please let me know what you like and don't like so I can adjust accordingly. After all it is
							your session.</p>

					<h2>Who am I?</h2>
					<p>
						<!-- You not only receive an affordable service but also gain access to the expertise and knowledge I've acquired during my soft tissue massage course. I'm dedicated to honing my skills and staying up-to-date with the latest techniques to ensure you receive the best possible treatment. -->
						My name is Tiago, and my fitness journey started later in life. However, I quickly became
						passionate and excited about health. In Portugal, there were ancient healers known as
						"Endireitas" who always fascinated me with their ability to help people instantly. According to
						old sayings, some learned their craft from healing animals, while others inherited their
						knowledge. They were the manual therapists of old times.
					</p>
					<p>
						Putting two and two together, I made the decision to delve into hands-on therapy. It all began
						with a one-day massage course, which then led to a year-long program, followed by various
						Continuing Professional Development (CPD) courses.

						From practicing on friends to ultimately launching my own massage business.
					</p>
					<p>
						And so, the journey continues - here I am, doing what I love! </p>
