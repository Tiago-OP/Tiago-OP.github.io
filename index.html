						<h2>What I Offer:</h2>

						<div class="massage-types">
							<div class="massage-type">
								<h3>Therapeutic/Sports Massage</h3>
								<p>In this type of massage, I will focus on specific problem areas using various
									techniques. This incorporates movement on your part, and mutual assessment until we reach a certain comfort level or improvement in mobility. I also offer dry needling if suitable for overall muscle recovery, with prior discussion and consent.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="massage-type">
								<h3>Deep Tissue/Relaxing Massage</h3>
								<p>This type of massage involves deep, slow strokes aimed at promoting release of tight muscles and
									relaxation. This is ideal for
									full-body sessions. A 90 or 120 minute session is recommended for an optimal experience.
									</div>
						</div>

						<p>Most of my sessions combine both elements. 
							<br>
							In order to
							provide a session that addresses your needs, comunication during the treatment is essential.
							Please let me know what you like and don't like so I can adjust accordingly. After all it is
							your session.</p>

					<h2>Who am I?</h2>
					<p>
						<!-- You not only receive an affordable service but also gain access to the expertise and knowledge I've acquired during my soft tissue massage course. I'm dedicated to honing my skills and staying up-to-date with the latest techniques to ensure you receive the best possible treatment. -->
						My name is Tiago, and and I have been on a journey of discovering fitness in pursuit of better health. In Portugal, there were ancient healers known as
						"Endireitas" with their ability to help people instantly. According to
						old sayings, some learned their craft from healing animals, while others inherited their
						knowledge. They were the manual therapists of old times.
					</p>
					<p>
						Combining my fascination with the old time manual therapists and fuelled by my growing interest in health, I made the decision to delve into hands-on therapy. It all began
						with a one-day massage course, which then led to a year-long program, followed by various
						Continuing Professional Development (CPD) courses.

						From practicing on friends to ultimately launching my own massage business.
					</p>
					<p>
						And so, the journey continues - here I am, doing what I love! </p>
